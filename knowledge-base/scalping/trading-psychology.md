# Trading Psychology for Scalping

## Overview
Scalping is one of the most psychologically demanding trading styles. The rapid-fire decision making, quick wins and losses, and intense focus required make mental preparation as important as technical skills.

## Core Psychological Challenges

### 1. Emotional Volatility
- Rapid sequence of wins and losses
- Emotional highs and lows
- Dopamine-driven behavior
- Overconfidence after wins
- Despair after losses

### 2. Decision Fatigue
- Hundreds of micro-decisions daily
- Mental exhaustion builds
- Quality of decisions degrades
- Increased errors over time

### 3. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)
- Watching price move without you
- Chasing entries
- Entering suboptimal setups
- Abandoning trading plan

### 4. Revenge Trading
- Trying to recover losses quickly
- Increasing position size
- Taking lower quality setups
- Emotional rather than logical

## Building the Right Mindset

### Accept Uncertainty
- No trade is guaranteed
- Losses are part of trading
- Focus on process, not outcome
- Think in probabilities

### Process Over Profits
- Execute your plan consistently
- Judge success by adherence to rules
- One good trade ≠ validation
- One bad trade ≠ failure

### Detachment from Results
- Don't celebrate wins too much
- Don't mourn losses too much
- Stay emotionally neutral
- Next trade is independent

## Pre-Trading Routine

### Mental Preparation
1. **Review trading plan**: Rules fresh in mind
2. **Check emotional state**: Am I fit to trade?
3. **Set daily limits**: Know when to stop
4. **Physical preparation**: Rested, fed, hydrated

### Environment Setup
- Distraction-free workspace
- Charts and tools ready
- Economic calendar checked
- Phone on silent
- Family/roommates aware

### Mindset Check Questions
- Am I trading to make money or prove something?
- Am I forcing trades or waiting for setups?
- Can I accept losing today?
- Am I following my plan?

## During Trading Psychology

### Staying Present
- Focus on current trade only
- Don't dwell on past trades
- Don't anticipate future trades
- One decision at a time

### Managing Winning Streaks
- Don't increase size dramatically
- Stick to your plan
- Avoid overconfidence
- Take regular breaks

### Managing Losing Streaks
- Reduce size or stop trading
- Review setup quality
- Check for market condition changes
- Don't chase losses

### The 3-Strike Rule
After 3 consecutive losses:
1. Stop trading for 15-30 minutes
2. Review the trades
3. Check market conditions
4. Assess emotional state
5. Only resume if conditions improve

## Common Psychological Traps

### 1. Confirmation Bias
- Seeing what you want to see
- Ignoring contradicting signals
- Over-interpreting favorable data
- **Solution**: Consider opposite view

### 2. Recency Bias
- Recent events affect decisions too much
- Last trade influences next trade
- **Solution**: Each trade is independent

### 3. Anchoring
- Fixating on certain price levels
- Entry price affecting exit decisions
- **Solution**: Trade what you see now

### 4. Sunk Cost Fallacy
- Holding losers because of invested time
- Moving stop losses
- Adding to losers
- **Solution**: Cut losses quickly

### 5. Gambler's Fallacy
- Thinking you're "due" for a win
- Increasing size after losses
- **Solution**: Each trade is independent
