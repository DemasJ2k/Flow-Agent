# Breaker Blocks

## Definition
A Breaker Block is an Order Block that has failed - meaning price broke through it and "broke" the expected support or resistance. When price returns to this former Order Block, it now acts in the opposite capacity (support becomes resistance, resistance becomes support).

## How Breaker Blocks Form

### Bullish Breaker (Former Bearish OB)
1. Bearish Order Block forms (resistance zone)
2. Price initially respects the zone and moves down
3. Price eventually breaks above the bearish OB
4. The broken bearish OB becomes a Bullish Breaker
5. Now acts as support on retests

### Bearish Breaker (Former Bullish OB)
1. Bullish Order Block forms (support zone)
2. Price initially respects the zone and moves up
3. Price eventually breaks below the bullish OB
4. The broken bullish OB becomes a Bearish Breaker
5. Now acts as resistance on retests

## Identifying Breaker Blocks

### Requirements
1. **Original Order Block**: Must be a valid OB (last opposing candle before move)
2. **Initial Reaction**: Price must react from the OB first
3. **Break**: Price must eventually break through the OB
4. **Return**: Price returns to test the broken level
5. **Opposite Reaction**: Price reverses from the Breaker

### Visual Pattern
```
Bullish Breaker:
[Bearish OB forms]
      ↓
[Price drops from OB]
      ↓
[Price rallies and breaks above OB]
      ↓
[Price returns to former OB = Bullish Breaker]
      ↓
[Price bounces = Entry opportunity]
```

## Trading Breaker Blocks

### Entry Strategy - Bullish Breaker
1. Identify failed bearish Order Block
2. Mark the zone (high to low of original OB)
3. Wait for price to return to this zone
4. Enter long at the Breaker Block
5. Stop loss below the Breaker
6. Target previous highs or next resistance

### Entry Strategy - Bearish Breaker
1. Identify failed bullish Order Block
2. Mark the zone (high to low of original OB)
3. Wait for price to return to this zone
4. Enter short at the Breaker Block
5. Stop loss above the Breaker
6. Target previous lows or next support

## Breaker Block vs Order Block

### Key Differences
| Aspect | Order Block | Breaker Block |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Direction | Same as original candle | Opposite to original candle |
| Formation | Before impulse move | After OB failure |
| Expectation | Price reverses | Price reverses (opposite direction) |
| Psychology | Unfilled institutional orders | Trapped traders, stop losses |

### Why Breakers Work
- Trapped traders: Those who traded the original OB are now trapped
- Stop losses: Their stops are beyond the Breaker
- Liquidity: Breaker zone contains their exit orders
- Institutions: Use this liquidity to enter

## Breaker Block Confluence

### Breaker + Fair Value Gap
- FVG within the Breaker zone
- Very high probability setup
- Enter at FVG within Breaker
- Tight stop, great R:R

### Breaker + OTE Zone
- Breaker falls within OTE zone (62-79%)
- Fibonacci confluence adds probability
- Multiple technical factors align
- Strong institutional interest

### Breaker + Liquidity Sweep
- Price sweeps liquidity before reaching Breaker
- Trapped traders already stopped out
- Clean entry at Breaker
- Higher probability reversal

## Multi-Timeframe Breakers

### HTF Breaker (Daily/H4)
- Major level of institutional interest
- Can hold for days/weeks
- Use for swing trade entries
- More significant reversals

### LTF Breaker (M15/M5)
- Intraday trading opportunities
- Faster moves and quicker targets
- Use within HTF context
- Good for scalping

### Alignment
- HTF Breaker + LTF Breaker = Very strong
- Enter on LTF Breaker within HTF Breaker zone
- Best risk:reward combination

## Breaker Block Entry Methods

### Method 1: Limit Order
- Place limit at the Breaker zone (50% level)
- Most aggressive approach
- Best R:R if it works
- May miss some trades

### Method 2: Confirmation Entry
- Wait for price to enter Breaker zone
- Look for LTF reversal confirmation
- Market order on confirmation
- More confirmed, slightly worse R:R

### Method 3: FVG within Breaker
- Identify FVG within Breaker zone
- Enter at the FVG
- Tightest stop placement
- Very refined entry

## When Breakers Fail

### Reasons for Failure
- Strong momentum continues through
- News events creating volatility
- Misidentified original Order Block
- Trading against HTF trend

### Failed Breaker = New Signal
- If Breaker breaks, it's information
- Trend continuation likely
- Don't fight it
- Wait for new structure

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Bullish Breaker Trade
1. Daily chart shows bearish OB at 1.1500
2. Price drops from 1.1500 to 1.1400
3. Price rallies and breaks above 1.1500
4. Drop to H1: Price pulls back to 1.1500
5. Enter long at 1.1500 (Breaker)
6. Stop at 1.1480
7. Target 1.1600

### Example 2: Bearish Breaker Trade
1. H4 shows bullish OB at 1.3000
2. Price bounces from 1.3000 to 1.3100
3. Price drops and breaks below 1.3000
4. Drop to M15: Price rallies back to 1.3000
5. Enter short at 1.3000 (Breaker)
6. Stop at 1.3020
7. Target 1.2900

## Breaker Block Checklist

Before trading a Breaker:
- [ ] Was there a valid original Order Block?
- [ ] Did price react from the OB initially?
- [ ] Did price break through the OB convincingly?
- [ ] Is price returning to the former OB zone?
- [ ] Is there additional confluence?
- [ ] Is this with the HTF trend?
- [ ] Is stop loss and target defined?
- [ ] Is risk appropriate (1-2%)?

## Common Mistakes

### What to Avoid
- Calling every broken level a Breaker
- Not verifying original OB validity
- Trading Breakers against HTF trend
- Entering before price reaches the zone
- Using tight stops on volatile Breakers

## Summary

Breaker Blocks are powerful reversal zones:
- Formed when Order Blocks fail
- Support becomes resistance (and vice versa)
- Contains trapped trader liquidity
- High probability when combined with other ICT concepts

Trade Breakers in direction of HTF trend, use additional confluence, and always manage risk properly. They offer excellent risk:reward when correctly identified.
