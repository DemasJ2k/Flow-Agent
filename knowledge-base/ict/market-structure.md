# Market Structure

## Definition
Market structure refers to the pattern of swing highs and swing lows that define the current trend or range in a market. Understanding market structure is fundamental to ICT trading as it provides context for all other concepts and determines trade direction.

## Basic Market Structure

### Bullish Market Structure
- Series of Higher Highs (HH) and Higher Lows (HL)
- Each high exceeds the previous high
- Each low is higher than the previous low
- Indicates upward momentum and buyer control

### Bearish Market Structure
- Series of Lower Highs (LH) and Lower Lows (LL)
- Each high is lower than the previous high
- Each low is lower than the previous low
- Indicates downward momentum and seller control

### Ranging/Consolidation
- Highs and lows remain within a range
- No clear directional bias
- Often precedes a breakout move
- Wait for structure break before trading

## Key Structural Points

### Swing High
- A peak with at least one lower high on each side
- More significant with more candles confirming
- Acts as resistance/supply zone
- Contains buy side liquidity above

### Swing Low
- A trough with at least one higher low on each side
- More significant with more candles confirming
- Acts as support/demand zone
- Contains sell side liquidity below

## Break of Structure (BOS)

### Bullish Break of Structure
- Price breaks above a previous swing high
- Confirms continuation of bullish structure
- Creates new higher high
- Look for pullback to Order Block for entry

### Bearish Break of Structure
- Price breaks below a previous swing low
- Confirms continuation of bearish structure
- Creates new lower low
- Look for pullback to Order Block for entry

## Change of Character (CHoCH)

### Definition
A Change of Character (also called Market Structure Shift) occurs when price breaks a key structural level in the opposite direction of the current trend, signaling a potential reversal.

### Bullish CHoCH
- In a downtrend (LH, LL pattern)
- Price breaks above a recent lower high
- First signal of potential trend change
- Wait for confirmation (new HL) before trading long

### Bearish CHoCH
- In an uptrend (HH, HL pattern)
- Price breaks below a recent higher low
- First signal of potential trend change
- Wait for confirmation (new LH) before trading short

## Multi-Timeframe Structure

### Timeframe Hierarchy
- **Monthly/Weekly**: Major trend direction (bias)
- **Daily**: Intermediate structure
- **H4/H1**: Short-term structure
- **M15/M5**: Entry structure

### Structure Alignment
- Best trades occur when structures align
- HTF bullish + LTF bullish = Long trades only
- HTF bearish + LTF bearish = Short trades only
- Conflicting structure = Stay out or reduce risk

### Premium and Discount Zones

#### Premium Zone (Above 50%)
- Upper half of the current range
- Better for selling in downtrends
- Avoid buying in this zone
- Institutions distribute here

#### Discount Zone (Below 50%)
- Lower half of the current range
- Better for buying in uptrends
- Avoid selling in this zone
- Institutions accumulate here

## Internal vs External Structure

### External Structure
- Major swing points on higher timeframes
- Define the larger trend
- Primary targets for moves
- More significant for bias

### Internal Structure
- Minor swings within the larger structure
- Used for entry timing
- Can break without changing overall trend
- Less significant for directional bias

## Structure and Liquidity

### Structure Breaks Target Liquidity
- Bullish BOS targets BSL above previous high
- Bearish BOS targets SSL below previous low
- Structure breaks often sweep liquidity
- Use liquidity targets for take profits

### False Breaks (Inducement)
- Price briefly breaks structure
- Triggers retail traders
- Reverses back into range
- Creates trapped traders (liquidity)

## Practical Application

### Step-by-Step Structure Analysis
1. Start on HTF (Daily/Weekly)
2. Mark all significant swing highs and lows
3. Determine overall structure (bullish/bearish/ranging)
4. Drop to MTF (H4/H1) for intermediate structure
5. Use LTF (M15/M5) for entry precision

### Trading with Structure

#### Long Trade Setup
1. HTF structure is bullish (HH, HL)
2. Wait for pullback (creating LTF bearish structure)
3. Look for CHoCH on LTF (back to bullish)
4. Enter at Order Block or FVG in discount zone
5. Target liquidity above or previous high

#### Short Trade Setup
1. HTF structure is bearish (LH, LL)
2. Wait for pullback (creating LTF bullish structure)
3. Look for CHoCH on LTF (back to bearish)
4. Enter at Order Block or FVG in premium zone
5. Target liquidity below or previous low

## Structure Failures

### When Structure Breaks Fail
- Strong counter-momentum
- News events
- End of trend moves
- Liquidity engineering

### Risk Management
- Always use stops beyond structure levels
- Accept that some structure breaks fail
- Don't revenge trade after failures
- Wait for new structure to form

## Common Mistakes

### What to Avoid
- Trading against HTF structure
- Chasing structure breaks
- Ignoring structure on multiple timeframes
- Not waiting for CHoCH confirmation
- Over-complicating structure analysis

## Summary

Market structure is the foundation of ICT trading. It provides:
- Directional bias for trades
- Context for other ICT concepts
- Entry and exit criteria
- Risk management framework

Always know what structure you're trading within. The best ICT trades occur when structure aligns across multiple timeframes and combines with other concepts like Order Blocks, FVGs, and Liquidity.
