# Optimal Trade Entry (OTE)

## Definition
The Optimal Trade Entry (OTE) is an ICT concept that identifies the ideal price level to enter a trade based on Fibonacci retracement levels, specifically targeting the 62-79% retracement zone of an impulse move. This zone offers the best risk-to-reward ratio for entries.

## The OTE Zone

### Key Fibonacci Levels
- **61.8%**: Beginning of OTE zone
- **70.5%**: Sweet spot (middle of OTE)
- **79%**: End of OTE zone

### Why These Levels Work
- Institutional algorithms often fill orders at these levels
- Provides optimal risk:reward (typically 3:1 or better)
- Deep enough retracement to confirm pullback
- Not so deep that it invalidates the move

## Identifying OTE Opportunities

### Requirements for Valid OTE
1. **Clear Impulse Move**: Strong directional movement
2. **Break of Structure**: The impulse breaks previous high/low
3. **Retracement**: Price pulls back into OTE zone
4. **Additional Confluence**: Order Block, FVG, or liquidity sweep

### Bullish OTE Setup
1. Identify bullish market structure (HH, HL)
2. Find strong bullish impulse that breaks structure
3. Draw Fibonacci from swing low to swing high
4. Wait for price to retrace to 62-79% zone
5. Enter long with stop below swing low

### Bearish OTE Setup
1. Identify bearish market structure (LH, LL)
2. Find strong bearish impulse that breaks structure
3. Draw Fibonacci from swing high to swing low
4. Wait for price to retrace to 62-79% zone
5. Enter short with stop above swing high

## OTE and Fibonacci Tool Setup

### How to Draw Fibonacci
- **Bullish**: Draw from swing LOW to swing HIGH
- **Bearish**: Draw from swing HIGH to swing LOW
- Use wicks or bodies (bodies are more conservative)

### Custom Fibonacci Levels
Set up your Fibonacci tool with these levels:
- 0% (Start/End of move)
- 50% (Equilibrium)
- 61.8% (OTE start)
- 70.5% (OTE sweet spot)
- 79% (OTE end)
- 100% (End/Start of move)
- -27% (First target)
- -62% (Second target)

## OTE Entry Methods

### Method 1: Limit Order at 70.5%
- Most aggressive approach
- Place limit order at 70.5% level
- Stop loss beyond 100% level
- Best risk:reward but may miss some trades

### Method 2: Zone Entry
- Wait for price to enter OTE zone
- Look for confirmation (reversal candle, LTF break)
- Enter with market order
- More confirmed but slightly worse R:R

### Method 3: Order Block in OTE
- Identify Order Block within OTE zone
- Wait for price to reach the OB
- Enter at OB with OTE confluence
- Highest probability approach

## OTE Targets

### Standard Targets
- **-27% Extension**: First target (conservative)
- **-62% Extension**: Second target
- **Previous Structure**: Swing high/low that was broken
- **Liquidity Above/Below**: Next liquidity pool

### Target Management
- Consider partial profits at first target
- Move stop to breakeven after first target
- Let remaining position run to full target
- Trail stop as price moves in favor

## OTE and Other ICT Concepts

### OTE + Order Block
- Order Block located within OTE zone
- Highest probability entry
- Enter at the OB, not just the Fib level
- Extra confluence = more confidence

### OTE + Fair Value Gap
- FVG within the OTE zone
- Price fills the FVG while in OTE
- Double confluence for entry
- Very clean setups

### OTE + Liquidity
- Liquidity swept just before OTE zone
- Enter after sweep at OTE level
- Institutions have filled orders
- Strong reversal potential

## Multi-Timeframe OTE

### HTF OTE for Bias
- Use Daily/H4 OTE for directional bias
- Identifies the zone where price should react
- Major institutional interest levels

### LTF OTE for Entry
- Use M15/M5 OTE for precise entry
- Within the HTF OTE zone
- Refines entry for better R:R

### Example
1. Daily shows price in OTE zone of larger move
2. Drop to H1 to find specific structure
3. Use M15 for final OTE entry
4. Stacked OTE = very high probability

## Common OTE Mistakes

### What to Avoid
- Entering before price reaches OTE zone
- Using OTE without market structure context
- Ignoring additional confluence
- Poor Fibonacci placement (wrong swing points)
- Not waiting for confirmation in OTE zone

### Risk Management
- Always use stop loss (beyond 100% level)
- Risk 1-2% maximum per trade
- Don't force OTE trades if confluence is weak
- Accept that some OTE setups won't work

## Practical Tips

### Best Practices
1. Always identify structure first (bullish/bearish)
2. Only draw Fibs from clear impulse moves
3. Look for confluence within OTE zone
4. Wait for price to ENTER the zone before considering entry
5. Use LTF confirmation for better timing

### OTE Checklist
- [ ] Clear market structure?
- [ ] Strong impulse move that broke structure?
- [ ] Fibonacci drawn correctly?
- [ ] Price in 62-79% zone?
- [ ] Additional confluence present?
- [ ] Stop loss and target defined?
- [ ] Risk appropriate (1-2%)?

## Summary

The Optimal Trade Entry is one of the most powerful ICT concepts for timing entries:
- Focus on the 62-79% retracement zone
- Always combine with market structure
- Look for additional confluence (OB, FVG)
- Use proper Fibonacci tool setup
- Best results during Killzones

OTE entries consistently offer 3:1 or better risk:reward when properly identified and executed within the right market context.
