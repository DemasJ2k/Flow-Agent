# Order Blocks (OB)

## Definition
An Order Block is the last bullish or bearish candle before a significant price move in the opposite direction. It represents areas where large institutional orders were placed, creating supply or demand zones that price often returns to.

## Types of Order Blocks

### Bullish Order Block
- The last bearish (down) candle before a strong bullish move
- Represents an area of demand/buying interest
- Price tends to return to this zone and bounce higher
- Look for the lowest candle body before the up move

### Bearish Order Block
- The last bullish (up) candle before a strong bearish move
- Represents an area of supply/selling interest
- Price tends to return to this zone and reverse lower
- Look for the highest candle body before the down move

## Identifying Valid Order Blocks

### Criteria for Valid OB
1. **Clear Displacement**: Must be followed by a strong, impulsive move
2. **Break of Structure**: The move following the OB should break market structure
3. **Imbalance Creation**: Should create Fair Value Gaps (FVG)
4. **Unmitigated**: The zone hasn't been revisited yet

### Order Block Zones
- **Open to Close**: Most conservative zone (candle body only)
- **High to Low**: More aggressive zone (includes wicks)
- **50% Level**: The midpoint of the OB, often provides precise entries

## Trading Order Blocks

### Entry Methods
1. **Limit Orders**: Place limit orders at the OB zone
2. **Market Orders**: Enter when price reaches the zone with confirmation
3. **50% Entry**: Enter at the 50% level of the OB for optimal risk:reward

### Stop Loss Placement
- Below the OB low (for bullish OB)
- Above the OB high (for bearish OB)
- Add a small buffer (few pips) beyond the zone

### Take Profit Targets
- Previous swing high/low
- Opposing Order Block
- Liquidity pools
- Fair Value Gap fills

## Order Block Refinement

### Refining to Lower Timeframes
1. Identify OB on higher timeframe (H4, Daily)
2. Drop to lower timeframe (M15, H1)
3. Find the specific OB within the larger zone
4. Entry at refined zone for better risk:reward

### Multiple Timeframe Confluence
- HTF OB + LTF OB alignment = Stronger zone
- Look for OBs that align across 2-3 timeframes
- Higher timeframe takes priority

## Order Block Failures

### When OBs Fail
- Strong momentum breaking through
- News events causing unusual volatility
- Old/stale OBs (already tested multiple times)
- Against overall market structure

### Risk Management
- Never risk more than 1-2% per trade
- Accept that some OBs will fail
- Use proper position sizing
- Always have a stop loss

## Examples

### Bullish OB Setup
1. Price is in an uptrend (higher highs, higher lows)
2. Identify the last down candle before a bullish break
3. Wait for price to retrace to the OB zone
4. Enter long with stop below OB
5. Target the next swing high or liquidity pool

### Bearish OB Setup
1. Price is in a downtrend (lower highs, lower lows)
2. Identify the last up candle before a bearish break
3. Wait for price to retrace to the OB zone
4. Enter short with stop above OB
5. Target the next swing low or liquidity pool

## Key Points to Remember

- Order Blocks are NOT support/resistance - they are specific institutional footprints
- Fresh (unmitigated) OBs are more reliable
- Higher timeframe OBs are more significant
- Always trade with the trend (use OBs for pullback entries)
- Combine with other ICT concepts for higher probability trades
