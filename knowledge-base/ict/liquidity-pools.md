# Liquidity Pools

## Definition
Liquidity pools are areas in the market where a large concentration of stop losses and pending orders exist. Institutional traders and market makers often target these areas to fill their large orders, causing price to move through these zones before reversing.

## Types of Liquidity

### Buy Side Liquidity (BSL)
- Located above swing highs and equal highs
- Contains stop losses from short sellers
- Contains buy stop orders from breakout traders
- Price sweeps above to trigger these orders

### Sell Side Liquidity (SSL)
- Located below swing lows and equal lows
- Contains stop losses from long traders
- Contains sell stop orders from breakdown traders
- Price sweeps below to trigger these orders

## Identifying Liquidity Pools

### Swing Points
- **Swing Highs**: Clear peaks with lower highs on both sides
- **Swing Lows**: Clear troughs with higher lows on both sides
- More significant on higher timeframes

### Equal Highs/Lows
- Two or more highs at nearly the same level
- Two or more lows at nearly the same level
- Very obvious liquidity targets
- Often called "double tops" or "double bottoms" by retail

### Trendlines
- Liquidity builds above ascending trendlines
- Liquidity builds below descending trendlines
- Institutions often break these lines before reversing

## Liquidity Concepts

### Liquidity Sweep (Raid)
- Price moves through a liquidity zone
- Triggers stop losses and pending orders
- Provides liquidity for institutional orders
- Often followed by reversal

### Liquidity Grab
- Quick spike through liquidity zone
- Immediate rejection (wick/shadow)
- Strong reversal signal
- Often occurs on lower timeframes

### Liquidity Run
- Price targeting multiple liquidity pools
- Continued movement in one direction
- Usually ends at a significant HTF level
- Can last hours to days

## Trading Liquidity

### Strategy 1: Fade the Sweep
1. Identify liquidity pool on HTF
2. Wait for price to sweep the pool
3. Look for reversal confirmation (Order Block, FVG)
4. Enter in opposite direction of sweep
5. Target opposing liquidity

### Strategy 2: Run with the Liquidity
1. Identify trend direction
2. Wait for pullback to liquidity
3. Enter as liquidity is taken
4. Ride the move to next liquidity target

### Strategy 3: Liquidity Void
1. Identify gap between current price and liquidity
2. Wait for price to fill the void
3. Enter at the liquidity level with reversal setup
4. Target the origin of the move

## Liquidity and Market Structure

### Bullish Structure + Liquidity
- Price takes sell side liquidity (SSL)
- Creates higher lows
- Targets buy side liquidity above
- Enter long after SSL sweep

### Bearish Structure + Liquidity
- Price takes buy side liquidity (BSL)
- Creates lower highs
- Targets sell side liquidity below
- Enter short after BSL sweep

## Institutional Behavior

### Why Institutions Need Liquidity
- Large orders can't be filled at single price
- Need opposing orders to match their trades
- Use retail stop losses to fill positions
- Create volatility to generate liquidity

### Stop Hunt Pattern
1. Price approaches obvious level
2. Brief spike beyond the level
3. Triggers retail stop losses
4. Quick reversal in opposite direction
5. Institutions filled, move continues

## External vs Internal Liquidity

### External Liquidity
- Liquidity outside current range
- Above range highs, below range lows
- Primary targets for larger moves
- Higher timeframe significance

### Internal Liquidity
- Liquidity within current range
- Fair Value Gaps and inefficiencies
- Short-term trading opportunities
- Often filled before external targets

## Time and Liquidity

### Session Liquidity
- **Asian Session**: Builds liquidity (range-bound)
- **London Open**: Often sweeps Asian liquidity
- **New York Open**: Sweeps London liquidity or continues

### Daily/Weekly Liquidity
- Monday: Often sweeps Friday's highs/lows
- Weekly highs/lows: Swept by end of week
- Monthly highs/lows: Major targets

## Risk Management

### Stop Placement
- Place stops beyond obvious liquidity
- Account for potential sweep before reversal
- Use wider stops with smaller position size
- Don't place stops at obvious levels

### Position Sizing
- Risk 1-2% per trade maximum
- Larger stops = smaller position
- Account for volatility around liquidity
- Never move stop into obvious liquidity

## Practical Applications

### Identifying Trade Opportunities
1. Mark all swing highs and lows
2. Note equal highs/lows
3. Identify which liquidity is closer
4. Wait for price to approach liquidity
5. Look for reversal setups after sweep

### Building a Liquidity Map
1. Start on weekly/daily timeframe
2. Mark major swing points
3. Drop to H4/H1 for intermediate levels
4. Use M15 for entry precision
5. Update map as new levels form

## Common Mistakes

### What to Avoid
- Placing stops at obvious liquidity levels
- Trading every liquidity sweep
- Ignoring market structure
- Not waiting for confirmation
- Over-trading around liquidity events

## Summary

Understanding liquidity is essential for ICT trading. Markets move from liquidity pool to liquidity pool as institutions fill their orders. By identifying where liquidity exists and understanding how it's targeted, traders can:
- Avoid getting stopped out by liquidity sweeps
- Enter trades after liquidity is taken
- Set realistic profit targets based on liquidity
- Trade in harmony with institutional order flow
