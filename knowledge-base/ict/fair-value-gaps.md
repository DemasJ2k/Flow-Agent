# Fair Value Gaps (FVG)

## Definition
A Fair Value Gap (also called Imbalance) is a three-candle pattern where the middle candle's body creates a gap between the wicks of the surrounding candles. This gap represents an area where price moved so aggressively that it left "unfilled" orders, creating an inefficiency that price often returns to fill.

## Types of Fair Value Gaps

### Bullish FVG (BISI - Buy Side Imbalance Sell Side Inefficiency)
- Created during strong upward price movement
- Gap between Candle 1's high and Candle 3's low
- Middle candle is bullish with large body
- Acts as a support/demand zone

### Bearish FVG (SIBI - Sell Side Imbalance Buy Side Inefficiency)
- Created during strong downward price movement
- Gap between Candle 1's low and Candle 3's high
- Middle candle is bearish with large body
- Acts as a resistance/supply zone

## Identifying Fair Value Gaps

### The Three-Candle Rule
1. **Candle 1**: The candle before the impulse move
2. **Candle 2**: The impulse candle (creates the gap)
3. **Candle 3**: The candle after the impulse move

### Gap Measurement
- Bullish FVG: From Candle 1 high to Candle 3 low
- Bearish FVG: From Candle 1 low to Candle 3 high
- The space between these levels is the FVG zone

## FVG Classifications

### By Size
- **Small FVG**: Less than 20 pips - often filled quickly
- **Medium FVG**: 20-50 pips - standard trading opportunity
- **Large FVG**: 50+ pips - may take longer to fill or remain open

### By Timeframe
- **HTF FVGs** (Daily, Weekly): Most significant, may take days/weeks to fill
- **MTF FVGs** (H4, H1): Good for swing trades
- **LTF FVGs** (M15, M5): Intraday trading opportunities

## Trading Fair Value Gaps

### Entry Strategies

#### Consequent Encroachment (CE)
- Enter at the 50% level of the FVG
- Provides optimal risk:reward
- Most refined entry method

#### Full Fill Entry
- Wait for price to fully fill the FVG
- Enter on reaction from the opposite side
- Lower risk but may miss some moves

#### Touch Entry
- Enter on first touch of the FVG zone
- More aggressive approach
- Higher win rate but larger stops needed

### Stop Loss Placement
- Beyond the FVG zone (opposite side)
- For bullish FVG: Stop below Candle 1's high
- For bearish FVG: Stop above Candle 1's low
- Add buffer for volatility

### Take Profit Targets
- The creation point of the FVG (swing high/low)
- Next significant FVG in direction of trade
- Order Blocks
- Liquidity pools

## FVG Behavior Patterns

### Respect
- Price touches the FVG and reverses
- Indicates strong institutional interest
- Often leads to continuation of original move

### Fill (Mitigation)
- Price completely fills the FVG
- Removes the inefficiency
- FVG becomes less significant after fill

### Inversion
- Bullish FVG becomes resistance after being filled
- Bearish FVG becomes support after being filled
- Creates potential reversal zones

## Fair Value Gap Confluence

### FVG + Order Block
- FVG that overlaps with an Order Block
- Very high probability trade setup
- Institutions often place orders at these confluences

### FVG + Fibonacci
- FVG at 50% or 61.8% retracement
- Strong confluence for entries
- Enhanced probability of reaction

### Nested FVGs
- FVG within a larger FVG from higher timeframe
- Extra confirmation for trade direction
- Refined entry zones

## When FVGs Fail

### Reasons for Failure
- Strong opposing momentum
- News events creating unusual price action
- Old/stale FVGs that have been tested multiple times
- Trading against overall market structure

### Risk Management
- Accept that some FVGs won't hold
- Use proper position sizing (1-2% risk)
- Always have defined stop loss
- Don't chase failed FVG entries

## Practical Tips

### Best Practices
1. Trade FVGs in direction of HTF trend
2. Look for unmitigated (fresh) FVGs
3. Combine with other ICT concepts
4. Use HTF FVGs for bias, LTF FVGs for entries
5. Don't force trades - wait for price to come to your zones

### Common Mistakes
- Trading every FVG regardless of context
- Ignoring market structure
- Not waiting for price to reach the zone
- Over-leveraging on FVG trades
- Trading old/already filled FVGs

## Summary

Fair Value Gaps are one of the most powerful ICT concepts. They represent genuine market inefficiencies that institutional traders often use for entries. When combined with other concepts like Order Blocks, Market Structure, and proper risk management, FVGs can provide high-probability trading opportunities across all markets and timeframes.
