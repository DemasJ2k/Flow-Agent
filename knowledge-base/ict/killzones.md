### Low Probability Times

- **17:00 - 20:00 EST**: Very low volume
- **Sunday evening**: Wide spreads, thin markets

## Killzone + ICT Concepts

### Best Combinations
- Killzone + Order Block = High probability
- Killzone + FVG = Clean entries
- Killzone + Liquidity Sweep = Reversal trades
- Killzone + Market Structure Break = Trend trades

### Example Setup
1. Identify HTF bias (Daily/H4)
2. Wait for Killzone to begin
3. Mark liquidity levels from Asian session
4. Watch for liquidity sweep
5. Enter on Order Block with FVG confluence
6. Target next liquidity pool

## Daylight Saving Considerations

### US DST (March - November)
- Standard killzone times apply
- Most liquid period

### Non-DST Period (November - March)
- Times shift by 1 hour
- London: 03:00 - 06:00 EST
- NY: 08:00 - 11:00 EST
- Adjust accordingly

## Risk Management in Killzones

### Position Sizing
- Same 1-2% risk rules apply
- Can slightly increase size during killzones
- Higher probability = more confidence, not more risk

### Stop Placement
- Keep stops beyond manipulation zones
- Account for killzone volatility
- Don't use tight stops during high volatility

### News Events
- Check economic calendar before trading
- Avoid 5 minutes before/after major news
- Or trade the news with wider stops
- FOMC, NFP, CPI require extra caution

## Common Mistakes

### What to Avoid
- Trading outside of killzones
- Chasing price early in sessions
- Ignoring Asian session setup
- Over-trading during killzones
- Not accounting for DST changes

## Summary

Killzones are when markets are most active and ICT setups work best:
- **Asian**: Range-building, liquidity setup
- **London**: First major move, sweeps Asian range
- **New York**: Highest volume, best setups
- **London Close**: Profit taking, potential reversals

Trade primarily during killzones, combine with other ICT concepts, and always respect the time-based nature of institutional trading.
